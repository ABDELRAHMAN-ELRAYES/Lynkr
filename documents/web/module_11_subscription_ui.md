# Module 11: Subscription - Web GUI Specification

## 1. Overview
The "Upgrade" experience. Must sell the value.

### SUB-001: Pricing Plans
*   **Visuals**:
    *   **Highlighted Plan**: The "Pro" plan should be scaled up 105% and have a "Most Popular" ribbon.
    *   **Toggle**: "Monthly" vs "Yearly (Save 20%)" toggle at top.
        *   Toggling to Yearly triggers a number roll animation changing prices (e.g. $29 -> $24).
*   **Feature Comparison**:
    *   Alternating gray/white rows for readability.
    *   Sticky Header for the table ("Free" vs "Pro" columns stay fixed when scrolling down capabilities).

## 3. Premium UI Touches
*   **Confetti on Upgrade**:
    *   Paying for a subscription is a celebration. Use gold confetti.
*   **Gradient Borders**:
    *   The "Pro" card should have a subtle moving gradient border to denote "Premium".
